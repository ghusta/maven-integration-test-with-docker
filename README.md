# Maven Integration Test with Docker

## Overview

The goal is to launch **integration tests** via Maven, using Docker to start and stop a container. 

The plugin [docker-maven-plugin](https://github.com/fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin) can help us to do that. See [documentation](https://dmp.fabric8.io/).

## Usage
